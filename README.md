Skills Demonstrated
Network Traffic Analysis

Skill: Proficient in using Wireshark to analyze PCAP files.
Explanation: You utilized Wireshark to capture and examine network packets. This involved analyzing PCAP file properties, protocol hierarchy, endpoints, and communication conversations.
Threat Modelling and Actor Profiling

Skill: Ability to model threats and profile potential threat actors.
Explanation: You created threat models to identify possible attack vectors and profiled the attacker’s techniques. This included identifying attack methods such as path traversal, local file inclusion, SQL injection, and command injection.
Statistical Analysis

Skill: Conducting statistical analysis of network traffic.
Explanation: You analyzed statistical data from the PCAP file, including protocol hierarchy, endpoint communication, and I/O graphs. This involved interpreting data related to network traffic patterns and identifying anomalies.
Attack Identification

Skill: Identifying and explaining various types of cyberattacks.
Explanation: You identified several types of attacks from the data, including path traversal, local file inclusion, SQL injection, and command injection. You also explained the nature of these attacks and their potential impact.
Technical Explanation of Attacks

Skill: Providing detailed technical explanations of attack techniques.
Explanation: You described how each attack type works and their potential vulnerabilities, citing relevant vulnerabilities and CVEs.
Mitigation Strategies

Skill: Developing and recommending strategies to mitigate identified attacks.
Explanation: You suggested various mitigation strategies, including input validation, secure coding practices, and implementing defensive measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Scripting and Automation

Skill: Writing Bash scripts for attack mitigation.
Explanation: You wrote Bash scripts to automate tasks such as isolating a server, blocking an attacker’s IP address, and reconnecting the server to the network. This demonstrates your ability to automate response actions in a cybersecurity context.
Comprehensive Reporting

Skill: Creating structured and detailed reports.
Explanation: You compiled a thorough report that includes an abstract, introduction, statistical analysis, activity narrative, attack identification, technical explanations, mitigation strategies, and appendices with scripts. This shows your ability to document and communicate findings effectively.
