<h1>Skills Demonstrated</h1>
<h2> Network Traffic Analysis</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Proficient in using Wireshark to analyze PCAP files.

<b>Explanation:</b> I utilized Wireshark to capture and examine network packets. This involved analyzing PCAP file properties, protocol hierarchy, endpoints, and communication conversations.
<h2>Threat Modelling and Actor Profiling</h2>

<h3>Skill: </h3>Ability to model threats and profile potential threat actors.

<b>Explanation:</b> I created threat models to identify possible attack vectors and profiled the attacker’s techniques. This included identifying attack methods such as path traversal, local file inclusion, SQL injection, and command injection.

<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Conducting statistical analysis of network traffic.

<b>Explanation:</b> I analyzed statistical data from the PCAP file, including protocol hierarchy, endpoint communication, and I/O graphs. This involved interpreting data related to network traffic patterns and identifying anomalies.

<h2>Attack Identification</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Identifying and explaining various types of cyberattacks.

<b>Explanation:</b> I identified several types of attacks from the data, including path traversal, local file inclusion, SQL injection, and command injection. I also explained the nature of these attacks and their potential impact.

<h2>Technical Explanation of Attacks</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Providing detailed technical explanations of attack techniques.

<b>Explanation:</b> I described how each attack type works and their potential vulnerabilities, citing relevant vulnerabilities and CVEs.

<h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Developing and recommending strategies to mitigate identified attacks.

<b>Explanation:</b> I suggested various mitigation strategies, including input validation, secure coding practices, and implementing defensive measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

<h2>Scripting and Automation</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Writing Bash scripts for attack mitigation.

<b>Explanation:</b> I wrote Bash scripts to automate tasks such as isolating a server, blocking an attacker’s IP address, and reconnecting the server to the network. This demonstrates my ability to automate 
response actions in a cybersecurity context.

<h2>Comprehensive Reporting</h2>

<h3>Skill:</h3> Creating structured and detailed reports.

<b>Explanation:</b> I compiled a thorough report that includes an abstract, introduction, statistical analysis, activity narrative, attack identification, technical explanations, mitigation strategies, and appendices with scripts. This shows my ability to document and communicate findings effectively.
